This lab is about determining certain words in a dictionary using regular expressions.  
The dictionary has one word per line.  However, it may include some capitalized words and 
non-word letters such as hyphens and apostrophes, and spaces.  The words being sought have 
none of these - all sought words have only word characters.

The input to the submitted command line script will be an integer in the range [71,80], except
 that #78 and 79 are not tested and automatically pass.  The script should output a regular expression 
 to determine the specified word or words.  All the questions are of the form: find the shortest/longest
  word  that ... , which means that each regular expression should contain a part that looks like {#,} or 
  {,#} which will prove the length aspect.  See below for mistake types.

# 70: where each vowel occurs at least once
# 71: containing exactly 5 vowels
# 72: with w acting as vowel
# 73: where if all but the first 3 and last 3 letters are removed, a palindrome results
# 74: where there is exactly one b and one t, and they are adjacent to each other
# 75: with the longest contiguous block of one letter
# 76: with the greatest number of a repeated letter
# 77: with the greatest number of adjacent pairs of identical letters
# 78: with the greatest number of consonants
# 79: where no letter is repeated more than once

Each regular expression should return at least 1 and no more than 12 lines, and the solution word(s) 
must (all) be included.  The longest or shortest proof as mentioned above must be included in the regex. 
Also the regex must not have any two consecutive letters from any of the solution words.

The current target is 256 chars
