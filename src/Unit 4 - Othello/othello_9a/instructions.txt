A short lab to find the symmetries of a rectangular board

Submitted script is given at least one, and possibly two command line arguments.  
The first argument represents a rectangular board, laid out by rows (such as an 
Othello, Sudoku, Tic-Tac-Toe, or slider boards).  The second argument, if provided, 
is an integer indicating the width of the board.  If it is not provided, then the 
width should be taken to be the smallest integer that evenly divides the length of 
the board that is no less than the square root of the length of the board.

The script is to output the set of all possible rotations and reflections of the
board as strings.  Each output string should go onto its own line.  There should be nothing 
else on that line (no commas, space, braces, etc.).  Do not print duplicates.

The grader, after removing any output line with a decimal number, will extract the final n 
lines of the remaining output having exactly k characters (excluding newlines), where n is 
the number of output values expected and k is the length of the input board.  The order of 
the extracted lines does not matter.  There are 20 test cases for this lab.
