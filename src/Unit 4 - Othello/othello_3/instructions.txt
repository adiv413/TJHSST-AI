This lab is an extension of the Othello 2 lab.  
The input for this lab should support multiple moves instead of just a single move.  
That is, the command line inputs to your script should be: an Othello board, a token, and a sequence of moves (either integers or A1 style).

As before, all arguments are optional.  No board means to use the standard Othello starting board.  
No move means to show the snapshot (see Othello 2 for an explanation) for the input board and exit.  
The token defaults to the token that would be played in the absence of any passes.  
However, if only one side could play on the input board, the token defaults to that side.

If a move is a negative integer, it should be skipped.

The output is a series of snapshots.  The first one is associated with the input board.  
The remainder is one snapshot per non-negative move.

An example input is: 44 29 22 52
